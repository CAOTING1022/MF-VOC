# MF-VOC
We adopt the method proposed by Guo et al. to get 14565 pairs of multi-focus images on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (MF-VOC). 
Moreover, we add some operations including random crop and rotation on the dataset.
Although many people have proposed methods to produce datasets of multi-focused images, few choose to make the datasets publicly available.
The data set has become almost a secret in the multi-focus fusion methods.
Finally we chose to make the dataset publicly available.
